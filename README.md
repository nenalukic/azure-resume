# azure-resume
Hello! 

This is my resume hosted in Azure. I am following the guidelines described in the book "[Cloud Resume Challenge Guidebook-Azure](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/)" by Forrest Brazeal.


## Project Objectives

This project consists of series of challenges:

1. **Development of a Website**: Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase resume details.
2. **Integration of a Visitor Counter**: Implementing a JavaScript-based visitor counter interacting with a database via an Azure Function in Python.
3. **Python Code Testing**: Inclusion of unit tests for the Python code.
4. **GitHub Repository**: Storage of all code within a GitHub repository.
5. **Automated Deployment**: Configuration of GitHub Actions for automated deployment of code changes to the production environment upon each commit.
6. **Testing Process Integration:** Establishing a testing process for API code with automated testing integrated into GitHub Actions.

## Preparation

Before starting the project, some tools needs to be installed and configured:

- Visual Studio Code with Azure Extensions

- The Azure CLI

- Configuration of the local Python environment for Azure

- Azure Functions Core Tools for local development of serverless functions

- An active Azure Account
